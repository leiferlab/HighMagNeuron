To check if you have the packages, run following steps

1. On della command line, type 

cd /projects/LEIFER/communalCode/HighMagNeuron/src

2. type
source /projects/LEIFER/communalCode/HighMagNeuron/venv/bin/activate

3. type
python HighResFlow.py
And then see if it complains about package missing.(check the bottom of this file about fixing)

4. type
python neuron_detect_hess.py 
And see if it complains about package missing.

5. type
python Himag_cline.py
And see if it complains about package missing. 






For packages you might need to install

1. First use the following virtual env by typing 

source /projects/LEIFER/communalCode/HighMagNeuron/venv/bin/activate

2. Then install some packages(some I noticed are as follows)
e.g. opencv_contrib_python, shapely
python -m pip install opencv_contrib_python
